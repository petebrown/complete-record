    "> Prior to the introduction of shirt numbers in the 1930's, nos. 1-11 indicate the traditional 1-2-3-5 team formation from 'keeper to outside left as reported in the newspapers.\n",

    "> Divisions of the Football League are contemporary (e.g. FL1 today is FL2 in season 1938-39) and PO = Play-off fixtures. The F A Cup/Round is shown as FA 1 etc with the addition of /R for a replay; the Football League Cup is shown similarly with two leg ties indicated as LC1/1, and LC1/2 etc. AM = Associate Members' Cup, FM = Full Members' Cup and AI = Anglo-Italian Tournament. Tournament sponsors' names have not been shown.\n",

    "> The order in which scorers appear does not necessarily indicate the order in which the goals were scored. Players' numbers are shown with an * when substituted by number 12, # by number 13 and + by number 14.\n",

    "> With the introduction of squad numbers in 1999-2000, this will change to S1, S2 and S3 for 1st, 2nd & 3rd subs.\n",
